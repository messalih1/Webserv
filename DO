-make server multi clientients using kqueue()


- Create a socket and bind it to a specific port
- Set the socket to listen for incoming connections
- Create a kqueue instance
- Add the listening socket to the kqueue instance using the kevent() function
- Wait for incoming connections using the kevent() function in a loop
- If a new client connection is detected, add the client socket to the kqueue instance
- If an existing client socket in the kqueue instance has data to read, read the data and process it
- If an existing client socket in the kqueue instance can be written to, send data to the client
- Here is some example code that demonstrates these steps:

 
 
EV_SET(&ev_set[0], server_socket, EVFILT_READ, EV_ADD, 0, 0, NULL);

    &ev_set[0]: a pointer to the first element of the struct kevent array
    server_socket: the file descriptor of the server socket to be monitored for events
    EVFILT_READ: the type of event to monitor, in this case, read events (i.e., incoming data)
    EV_ADD: the action to perform, in this case, add the event to the kqueue instance
 
 
 

int kq = kqueue()
     instance is created, you can use it to monitor multiple file descriptors for events


- kq: the kqueue descriptor returned by the kqueue() function.

- changelist: a pointer to an array of struct kevent structs that specify changes to the events being monitored. 
In this case, we are not making any changes, so we pass NULL.

- nchanges: the number of events in the changelist. Since we are not making any changes, we pass 0.

- eventlist: a pointer to an array of struct kevent structs that will be filled in by the kevent() function with 
the events that have occurred. This is where we receive notifications about the events we are monitoring.

- nevents: the maximum number of events to return in the eventlist array. We set this to MAX_EVENTS.
- timeout: a pointer to a struct timespec struct that specifies how long kevent() should wait for events to occur. 
We are not setting a timeout, so we pass NULL.

After this function call, the ev_list array will be filled with the events that have occurred, up to a maximum of 
MAX_EVENTS. The number of events actually returned is stored in the nev variable. We can then loop through the 
ev_list array to process each event.
